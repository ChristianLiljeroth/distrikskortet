Website for finding all Danish addresses within a specified area. The project is a few years old by now, and would preferably move a lot of the functionality to server-side, if I did the project today.

I have used a couple of available libraries in the project:
JQUERY V3.3.1 https://jquery.com/
JS-MAP-LABEL https://github.com/googlearchive/js-map-label
HULL https://github.com/AndriiHeonia/hull
JQUERY-TABLESORT https://github.com/kylefox/jquery-tablesort
